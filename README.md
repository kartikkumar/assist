General C++ Tools
=============

This repository catalogues miscellaneous General C++ tools that I have written for my research.

These tools are work-in-progress, and as such, I provide no assurances that they achieve the intended results in the manner conceived (in other words, don't blame me if you use any of these tools and they don't turn out to work as you expected).

I'm very open to suggestions and improvements, so feel free to teach me a thing or two.

These tools are written off of the following open-source libraries:

- Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)
- Boost (http://www.boost.org)
- Tudat & Tudat Core (http://tudat.tudelft.nl)
